### Update Summary Format
After processing each exam, the scraper displays:
```
üìä Update Summary:
   ‚úÖ New questions added: X
   üîÑ Existing questions updated: X
   ‚è≠Ô∏è Questions skipped (no changes): X
‚úÖ EXAM-CODE: X questions updated successfully
```

Requirements: Python 3.6+, `tqdm` library, write access to `public/data/` directory.

## Architecture Overview

This is a modern Next.js 15 application with App Router for ServiceNow certification exam preparation.

### Core Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand stores with persistence
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with custom styling
- **Data Storage**: Static JSON files in `/public/data/` with client-side processing

### Key Stores (Zustand)

- `examStore` (`src/stores/examStore.ts`): Manages exam data, question states, progress tracking, exam mode, and session management
- `settingsStore` (`src/stores/settingsStore.ts`): User preferences, application settings, and modal state management  
- `statisticsStore` (`src/stores/statisticsStore.ts`): Session tracking, performance analytics, and exam statistics

### Data Structure

```
public/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json          # Central exam catalog with metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [EXAM_CODE]/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exam.json          # Questions and answers
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ links.json         # External resources
```

### Component Organization

- `src/components/exam/` - Exam-specific components (ExamViewer, ExamSelector, ExamTimer, ExamHeader)
- `src/components/question/` - Question display and interaction logic
- `src/components/navigation/` - Navigation controls and sidebar management
- `src/components/modals/` - Modal dialogs (Settings, Statistics, Export, Favorites, Exam Configuration/Results)

## Mobile Optimization

### Ultra-Aggressive Scroll Lock System
The application features a sophisticated scroll lock system specifically designed for mobile devices to prevent any unwanted scrolling during user interactions:

- **Complete Page Freeze**: During button interactions (validate, show answer, reset), the entire page is locked using `position: fixed` on both `body` and `html` elements
- **Event Prevention**: All scroll-related events (`scroll`, `touchmove`, `touchstart`, `touchend`, `wheel`) are completely blocked during interactions
- **300ms Lock Duration**: Extended lock time on mobile ensures zero scroll clipping
- **Automatic Mobile Detection**: Intelligent detection via user agent and screen width
- **Sound Interference Prevention**: Audio effects are disabled on mobile to prevent `setTimeout` conflicts
- **CSS Reinforcement**: Additional CSS classes (`.scroll-locked`, `.ultra-locked`) provide bulletproof scroll prevention
- **Position Restoration**: Multiple attempts to restore exact scroll position after interaction

This system ensures users experience zero scroll movement during question interactions, maintaining perfect position stability.

### Revolutionary Sidebar Navigation (v5.1.0)
The sidebar has been completely redesigned for mobile devices with native scroll integration:
- **Native Scroll Replacement**: Replaced Radix ScrollArea with native `overflow-y: auto` for superior mobile compatibility
- **Body Scroll Isolation**: Implemented body scroll lock (`position: fixed`) when sidebar is open to prevent background page scrolling
- **Advanced Event Management**: Touch and wheel events are captured and prevented from propagating to parent elements
- **Flexbox Layout Architecture**: Complete restructure using `flex flex-col` for precise height management across all screen sizes
- **Platform-Specific Rendering**: Separate mobile (`md:hidden`) and desktop (`hidden md:block`) rendering paths for optimal UX
- **Fixed Positioning with Hardware Acceleration**: Sidebar maintains fixed position during page scroll using `transform: translateZ(0)`
- **Precise Height Calculations**: Smart mobile height using `calc(100vh - 4rem - 60px - 4rem - 4rem)` accounting for all UI elements

### Enhanced Mobile Input Experience (v5.1.0)
Optimized touch interactions and input handling for mobile devices:
- **Automatic Numeric Keyboards**: Custom exam inputs trigger `inputMode="numeric"` for seamless number entry
- **Force Card View**: Mobile devices automatically use card view layout for optimal touch browsing

## Dynamic Domain Management System (v5.2.0)

The application features a sophisticated, configurable domain management system that automatically categorizes ServiceNow exams into knowledge domains for advanced analytics and performance tracking.

### Three-Tiered Detection System
1. **Manifest Integration**: Domains explicitly defined in `manifest.json` take highest priority
2. **Pattern-Based Auto-Detection**: RegExp patterns automatically categorize exams based on exam codes
3. **Configuration Overrides**: Manual assignments override auto-detection for specific exams
4. **Fallback System**: Unrecognized exams default to "Development" domain

### Supported ServiceNow Domains
- **ITSM** (IT Service Management): CIS-ITSM, CIS-EM, CIS-Discovery, CIS-SM
- **Security**: CIS-SIR, CIS-VR, CIS-VRM, CIS-RC  
- **HR** (Human Resources): CIS-HR, HR-related exams
- **Asset Management**: CIS-HAM, CIS-SAM, Asset-related exams
- **Service Management**: CIS-SM, Service-related certifications
- **Portfolio Management**: CIS-PPM, Portfolio-related exams
- **Development**: CAD, CSA, CIS-CSM, Development-related exams
- **Infrastructure**: Server-related and infrastructure exams

### Auto-Detection Patterns (`src/utils/domainMapping.ts`)
```typescript
export const DOMAIN_DETECTION_PATTERNS: Record<ServiceNowDomain, DomainPattern> = {
  "ITSM": { pattern: /^(CIS-ITSM|CIS-EM|CIS-Discovery|CIS-SM)$/i, priority: 10 },
  "Security": { pattern: /^(CIS-SIR|CIS-VR|CIS-VRM|CIS-RC)$/i, priority: 9 },
  // ... other patterns with priority-based matching
};
```

### Domain Management Interface
- **Settings Integration**: Access via Settings ‚Üí Domain Management
- **Visual Domain Overview**: Grid layout showing exam distribution across domains
- **Real-Time Editing**: Click-to-edit domain assignments with immediate updates
- **Confidence Indicators**: Visual feedback on auto-detection confidence levels
- **Reset to Auto-Detected**: Restore original auto-detected domain assignments
- **Override Management**: View and manage manual domain overrides

### Python Integration (`scripts/update_manifest.py`)
The manifest generation script automatically detects domains during processing:
```python
def detect_servicenow_domain(exam_code):
    domain_patterns = {
        'ITSM': [r'^CIS-ITSM', r'^CIS-EM', r'^CIS-Discovery', r'^CIS-SM'],
        'Security': [r'^CIS-SIR', r'^CIS-VR', r'^CIS-VRM', r'^CIS-RC'],
        # ... mirrors TypeScript patterns exactly
    }
```

### Analytics Integration
- **Performance Heatmaps**: Visual representation of accuracy across domains
- **Domain-Specific Statistics**: Detailed metrics per knowledge area
- **Temporal Filtering**: 7d/30d/all-time analysis per domain
- **Exam Breakdown**: Individual exam performance within domains
- **Improvement Tracking**: Trend analysis for focused learning

### Configuration Management
- **Runtime Updates**: Changes take effect immediately without restart
- **Persistent Storage**: Domain overrides saved in localStorage
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient batch updates for multiple exams
- **Validation**: Ensures data consistency across all domain assignments
